# The Hutchison Research Group

> “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”
- Pres. John F. Kennedy

The Hutchison Research Group focuses on understanding fundamental properties of π-conjugated molecules to design new materials. We combine computational exploration, often using evolutionary algorithms and machine learning, with experimental characterization.

Science can be hard, but it should also be fun.

## Expectations

### Everyone

#### Big Picture

-	Work on what you’re passionate about, work hard at it, and be proud of it. Be so proud of it that you have to suppress bragging (but it’s ok to brag sometimes).
-	Scientists have to be careful. Don’t rush your work. Think about it. Implement it. Double and triple check it. Incorporate sanity checks. Ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. It’s ok to makes mistakes, but mistakes shouldn’t be because of carelessness or rushed work.
-	If you do make a mistake, you should definitely tell your collaborators (if they have already seen the results, and especially if the paper is being written up, is already submitted, or already accepted). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.
-	We all want to get papers published and do great things. But we do this honestly. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in *any way*. Science is about finding out the truth, and null results and unexpected results are still important. This can’t be emphasized enough: no academic misconduct!
    - If you think there's any question (e.g., leaving data out of statistical analysis, applying filters to images, etc.) then you should ask others and especially Geoff to make careful decisions.
-	Support your fellow lab-mates. Help them out if they need help (even if you aren’t on the project), and let them vent when they need to. Science is collaborative, not competitive. Help others, and you can expect others to help you when you need it.
-	Respect your fellow lab-mates. Respect their strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it, and for support and a kind ear when they need that. Respect their culture, their religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation.
-	If you’re struggling, tell someone (feel free to tell Geoff!). Your health and happiness come first. The lab looks out for the well-being of all its members. We are here to help. It’s ok to go through hard patches (we all do), but you shouldn’t feel shy about asking for help or just venting.
_	If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. We can’t thrive in an environment we aren’t comfortable, and disrespect or rudeness will not be tolerated in the lab. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Geoff. In any case, tell Geoff.
•	If you have a problem with Geoff and are comfortable telling him about it, please do! If you aren’t comfortable, then tell someone else (for smaller issues) or another member of the chemistry department (for more serious issues).
-	Stay up to date on the latest research, by using RSS/Atom feeds and/or getting journal table of contents. Also consider following scientists in the field on Twitter. If you don't know how to do these, just ask.
-	Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and don’t ever feel bad for taking time off work.

#### Small Picture

There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to keep the lab running smoothly.

-	If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick.
-	You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it). One caveat is that some equipment is more readily available at odd times (e.g., for longer experiments).
-	Make sure the door to the office lab is closed (and thus locked) if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you’re the last one leaving for the day.
-	Keep the lab tidy. Eating in office is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.
-	Dress code is casual (and you can dress up if you want!) but chemical lab safety rules apply. If you are in lab, you need long pants and long shirt or lab coat. Other facilities (e.g., the NFCF) have additional requirements to minimize dust or contamination.


### Principal Investigator

I promise to also...
-	Support you (scientifically, intellectually, emotionally, financially)
-	Give you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants
-	Be available in person and via Slack/e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
- Send you suggestions, ideas, interesting papers relevant to your project when I encounter them - that you are free to handle as you see best. (i.e., ultimately it's your project and you may have better ideas than I do)
-	Give my perspective on where the lab is going, where the field is going, and tips about surviving and thriving in science and academia
-	Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and letting you attend conferences as often as finances permit
-	Help you prepare for the next step of your career, no matter what it may be or if it changes over time
-	Care for your emotional and physical well-being, and prioritize that above all else

### Graduate Students

### Undergraduate Students

Undergraduate Students

All of the above, and you will also be expected to…
-	Assist other lab members with data collection and analysis (unless you are working on your own independent project under the mentorship of another lab member, in which case you should work on that)
-	Develop your weekly schedule by talking to your graduate student mentor or Geoff. You should be coming in every week, and scheduling enough time to get your work done.
-	If you are earning course credit for research, you must also attend lab meetings when your schedule permits, present at one of these lab meetings, and submit a write-up of your research by the end of the semester

### Experimental Work

We perform a lot of atomic force microscopy (AFM).

## General Notes

### Data Preservation

You should back up your computer. Backups are important for many reasons, but because you do not wish to lose data, writing, or anything else related to your work or digital life. I recommend (and use) both a regular backup drive and an online service. Geoff personally uses [BackBlaze](http://backblaze.com) but other services are also good. Automatic backup is key.

Pitt provides unlimited storage via Box.com which is useful for storing key data. Geoff uses both Box Sync and Dropbox to ensure his files are both online and backed up. More importantly both services allow us to collaborate on manuscripts (e.g., as you edit, finish figures, etc.).

When you leave the group, it is important that a copy of all your data is preserved for future work - the group has a networked RAID with 10TB storage that is maintained by Geoff - he will be happy to show you how to copy your data or access older group files.

### Hours and Time Management

Hours in academia are more flexible than other jobs -- but you should still treat it as a real job (~40 hours/week) and show up on a regular basis. Some times will be busier than others and some times you may need to take work off (e.g., parents visiting, car repairs, doctors appointments, etc.). My main concern is that you're getting work done and that I see everyone on a regular basis.

***Take care of yourself.*** I fully believe that you can’t do your best work when you’re worn down, sick, tired, burnt out etc. Graduate school is a long process and the problems we tackle will take weeks and months, not days. Things won't always work. Self care is important and if there's time you want to work from home, take a day off, etc. just let me know.


## Funding

Funding for the group comes from a number of sources. If you're not sure the source of your funding, please ask. It is important to add acknowledgments to posters, presentation slides, and publications.

This includes not just raw funding ($$) but also resources like the Pitt Center for Research Computing (CRC) which provides computer time.

### Purchasing

If you need to buy something and are unsure how the process works, please contact Geoff. Some items should be charged to grants (i.e., for materials needed to carry out research) and some materials (e.g., office supplies) should be charged to internal accounts.

### Grant Preparation

At some point, you will probably be asked to provide a figure or three for a grant proposal or to provide feedback on a draft. Relatedly, you should feel free to read any grant Geoff has submitted, whether it is ultimately funded or not. Aside from being a good opportunity to see how grants are written, this also helps provide you with vision for where Geoff sees research going in the next few years.

## Last words

> We make tiny things which make power from the sun and other tiny things which make power from moving. These things can help power the world.
> We think hard about how stuff really works and how tiny things come together to make a whole.  By asking how tiny things work, we can make them work better.
> Part of our job is also to help other people to learn these things, and how to ask and answer new questions.
